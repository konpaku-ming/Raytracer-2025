### Multi-threading (5 pts)
We highly recommend you to use multi-threading to accelerate your ray tracer, as it is a very common technique in computer graphics. You may use `std::thread` or custom libraries like `rayon` to implement this feature.
### GPU Acceleration (20? pts)
If you are familiar with GPU programming, you can try to implement a GPU version of your ray tracer. [This repository](https://github.com/RayTracing/gpu-tracing) is a sequal of the *Ray Tracing in One Weekend* series, which implements a ray tracer on the GPU using WebGPU (not finished yet). [This article](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/accelerated-ray-tracing-cuda/) instead use CUDA for implementation. Our TAs have some hardware support for GPU and feel free to ask for help.
